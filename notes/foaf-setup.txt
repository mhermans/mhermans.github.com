Four requirements:
* Stable, cool uri
* Dereferencable
* Not only rdf, but a html-version for humans/browsers when dereferencing
* and this without registering/commiting to a domain of my own.

Solution: a Purl, with Apache-content negotiation.

Coining a Purl is as simple as registering a user at purl.org, picking a stable refering url, picking a (variabele) refered url and cliking submit. In my case http://purl.oclc.org/net/mhermans-foaf
